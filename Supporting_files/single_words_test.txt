C
is
the
most
commonly
used
programming
language
for
writing
operating
systems
The
first
operating
system
written
in
C
is
Unix
Later
operating
systems
like
Linux
were
all
written
in
C
Not
only
is
C
the
language
of
operating
systems
it
is
the
precursor
and
inspiration
for
almost
all
of
the
most
popular
high
level
languages
available
today
In
fact
Perl
PHP
Python
and
Ruby
are
all
written
in
C
By
way
of
analogy
let
us
say
that
you
were
going
to
be
learning
Spanish
Italian
French
or
Portuguese
Do
you
think
knowing
Latin
would
be
helpful
Just
as
Latin
was
the
basis
of
all
of
those
languages
knowing
C
will
enable
you
to
understand
and
appreciate
an
entire
family
of
programming
languages
built
upon
the
traditions
of
C
Knowledge
of
C
enables
freedom
Why
C
and
not
assembly
language
While
assembly
language
can
provide
speed
and
maximum
control
of
the
program
C
provides
portability
Different
processors
are
programmed
using
different
assembly
languages
and
having
to
choose
and
learn
only
one
of
them
is
too
arbitrary
In
fact
one
of
the
main
strengths
of
C
is
that
it
combines
universality
and
portability
across
various
computer
architectures
while
retaining
most
of
the
control
of
the
hardware
provided
by
assembly
language
Assembly
while
extremely
powerful
is
simply
too
difficult
to
program
large
applications
and
hard
to
read
or
interpret
in
a
logical
way
C
is
a
compiled
language
which
creates
fast
and
efficient
executable
files
It
is
also
a
small
language
A
C
statement
corresponds
to
at
most
a
handful
of
assembly
statements
everything
else
is
provided
by
library
functions
So
is
it
any
wonder
that
C
is
such
a
popular
language
Like
toppling
dominoes
the
next
generation
of
programs
follows
the
trend
of
its
ancestors
Operating
systems
designed
in
C
always
have
system
libraries
designed
in
C
Those
system
libraries
are
in
turn
used
to
create
higher
level
libraries
and
the
designers
of
those
libraries
often
decide
to
use
the
language
the
system
libraries
used
Application
developers
use
the
higher
level
libraries
to
design
word
processors
games
media
players
and
the
like
Many
of
them
will
choose
to
program
in
the
language
that
the
higher
level
library
uses
And
the
pattern
continues
on
and
on
and
on
Why
C
and
not
another
language
The
primary
design
of
C
is
to
produce
portable
code
while
maintaining
performance
and
minimising
footprint
This
is
useful
for
operating
systems
embedded
systems
or
other
programs
where
performance
matters
a
lot
With
C
it
is
relatively
easy
to
keep
a
mental
picture
of
what
a
given
line
really
does
